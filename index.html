      <h2>Why this page?</h2>
      <div id="text">
        <p>I chose this website because I think the header and footer can be improved easily, and their design 
          isn’t really seamless. I feel like this application page can be updated to match other recently, well 
          designed applications.
          </p>

      <h2>Some problems</h2>

      <h2>Efficiency:</h2>
      <div id="left-text">
          <ul>
            <li>I think the submit button should be centered or on the right side.</li>
            <li>I want to explore how it would look if all the options were aligned in columns rather than two in a row. That way the user can just scan vertically.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Learnability:</h2>
      <div id="left-text">
          <ul>
            <li>
              I think the website does a good job describing what to do at each question. However, for the questions with options, I plan to make them radio buttons.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Memorability:</h2>
      <div id="left-text">
          <ul>
            <li>
              The header and heading area doesn’t do a great job creating a memorable brand for the New England Aquarium. I plan to fix the header and footer areas to
               make the design more consistent. There are two of the same logos and one of them does not match the background color.  
            </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Accessibility Problems:</h2>
      <div id="left-text">
          <ul>
            <li>While using WebAIM WAIVE, a few contrast problems were detected between the text and background colors. This is for when phrases like “Select option” were
               written in the text box. I think it might be okay because the box is empty and it might seem intuitive to click to select the option.</li>
            <li>Another problem was that the contrast was low where you could select what page you wanted to go to. I agree, this could be fixed. </li>
            <li> Lastly, the website is missing a first level heading. I think this could be fixed. </li>
           <li>It seems like the website is well done in terms of aria labels.</li>
          </ul>

             locks so the user needs to have a set of keys accessible a few moments prior to unlocking the 
             unit door. But to get into the unit door specifically, the keypad is used.</td>

            passing by when their door is unlocked. For a typical door lock, it is not clear if the door is locked 
            unless you try the door, and the same principle applies here.</td>

        <p>I was surprised to find people were relatively satisfied with the interface. This makes sense since
          the keypad lock is popular these days, especially as remote controlled door locks become more 
          common with security systems.</p>
